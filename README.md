# Horiseon Webpage Re-Design

## Project Description
This re-design is primarily behind the scenes, but intented to ease the challenge for future developers to enhance this webpage.

## General Information
I have gone through the HTML elements and worked to clean them up and rename them semantically. The CSS has been slightly modified and commented for ease of purpose identification.
